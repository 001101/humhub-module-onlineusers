# Online Users Widget v1.0.0 by 001101
## humhub-modules-onlineusers
Adds a widget on the Dashboard and display the online users.

## Working with 1.*

It is simply based on the already implemented, but badly documentated function for online users from the directory 
and is mashed up in the 'new-members module'.

It will show up under last activities and show up max. 70 (10 rows of icons) users per default,
you can set max users in Admin Panel and the position can be set up 
in the file 'onlineusers\Module.php' on line 14 'sortOrder' => 250',
just play around, 100 is over activities and so on.

# INSTALL: 
- Clone or Upload as `onlineusers` in your `humhub/protected/modules` folder.
